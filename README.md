# HPS

Small proof of concept in which I use the VIPER architecture as well as a customized NetWorkLayer. For this test, the Itunes API is used.

It consists of 2 screens:
1) A SearchBar where it lists the found songs.
2) A DetailView with a player of the selected song and the results of the previous search.
